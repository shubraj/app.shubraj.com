  <h2>Convert SVG to JPG with Control Over Quality and Size</h2>
  <p>Turn vector artwork into widely compatible JPGs for presentations, CMS uploads, and social sharing. Rasterization gives you predictable appearance across tools that don’t handle SVG.</p>

  <h3>When SVG → JPG Makes Sense</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Legacy pipelines:</strong> Some systems only accept raster images.</li>
    <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Platforms often prefer JPG for photos and artwork.</li>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> Many clients render JPG more consistently than SVG.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Export at sufficient resolution for the target display or print size.</li>
    <li>Use a white or brand‑colored background if transparency isn’t desired.</li>
  </ul>
