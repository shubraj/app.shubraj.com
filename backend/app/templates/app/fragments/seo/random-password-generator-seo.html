  <h2>Create Strong, Memorable Passwords On Demand</h2>
  <p>Generate passwords with the right mix of length, symbols, and randomness. Use presets for quick choices or tune character sets to match your policy requirements.</p>

  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer longer passphrases or 16+ character passwords when allowed.</li>
    <li>Use a password manager instead of reusing variations by hand.</li>
    <li>Enable MFA for important accounts—passwords alone aren’t enough.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Good Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>New app accounts during testing and onboarding.</li>
    <li>Rotating credentials for services and integrations.</li>
  </ul>
