  <h2>Resize Images to Exact Dimensions</h2>
  <p>Set width and height, preserve aspect ratio, and export in common formats. Ideal for thumbnails, social banners, and email‑friendly versions of large photos.</p>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Resize before compressing to avoid double work.</li>
    <li>Keep originals; resizing is a one‑way operation.</li>
    <li>Use vector formats when you need crisp scaling without blur.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Targets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Open Graph images, favicons, and app icons.</li>
    <li>Responsive breakpoints for hero banners and product shots.</li>
  </ul>
