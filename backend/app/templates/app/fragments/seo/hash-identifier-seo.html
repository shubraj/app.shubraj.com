  <h2>Identify Hash Algorithms from Hash Strings</h2>
  <p>Determine which hash algorithm produced a given hash string by analyzing its length, format, and character patterns. Useful when working with legacy systems, debugging authentication issues, or verifying hash formats.</p>

  <h3>How Hash Identification Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Length analysis:</strong> Each hash algorithm produces outputs of specific lengths (e.g., MD5 = 32 hex chars, SHA-256 = 64 hex chars).</li>
    <li><strong>Format patterns:</strong> Some hashes have distinctive prefixes (like bcrypt's <code>$2a$</code>) or structures.</li>
    <li><strong>Character sets:</strong> Hex hashes use <code>a-f0-9</code>, while Base64-encoded hashes include <code>A-Za-z0-9+/=</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Hash Types</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MD5:</strong> 32 hex characters — fast but cryptographically broken, still common in checksums.</li>
    <li><strong>SHA-256:</strong> 64 hex characters — widely used for file verification and Git commits.</li>
    <li><strong>SHA-512:</strong> 128 hex characters — stronger variant for sensitive applications.</li>
    <li><strong>bcrypt:</strong> 60 characters starting with <code>$2a$</code>, <code>$2b$</code>, etc. — designed for password hashing.</li>
    <li><strong>Argon2:</strong> Variable length with <code>$argon2</code> prefix — modern password hashing standard.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Some hashes (like MD5 and NTLM) share the same length and format; context helps distinguish them.</li>
    <li>Base64-encoded hashes may require decoding to confirm the underlying algorithm.</li>
    <li>Custom or non-standard hashes may not be identified.</li>
  </ul>
