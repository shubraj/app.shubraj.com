  <h2>Comprehensive Security Headers Audit for Any Domain</h2>
  <p>Verify that a domain implements recommended HTTP security headers. This tool checks HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and other critical headers, providing a security score and actionable recommendations.</p>

  <h3>Security Headers Checked</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):</strong> Forces HTTPS connections and prevents downgrade attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Content-Security-Policy (CSP):</strong> Reduces XSS risks by controlling which resources can load.</li>
    <li><strong>X-Frame-Options:</strong> Prevents clickjacking by controlling iframe embedding.</li>
    <li><strong>X-Content-Type-Options:</strong> Stops MIME-type sniffing attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Referrer-Policy:</strong> Controls how much referrer information is sent.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions-Policy:</strong> Restricts access to browser features and APIs.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Origin Policies (COEP/COOP/CORP):</strong> Control cross-origin resource sharing and isolation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Additional Security Checks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cookie Security:</strong> Analyzes Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite flags on all cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>TLS Version:</strong> Verifies the TLS/SSL protocol version (TLS 1.2+ recommended).</li>
    <li><strong>CORS Policy:</strong> Reviews Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration and identifies misconfigurations.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Disclosure:</strong> Detects headers that reveal server versions, frameworks, or infrastructure details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What the Security Score Means</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Excellent (80-100%):</strong> Most critical headers are present and properly configured.</li>
    <li><strong>Good (60-79%):</strong> Major security headers are in place with room for improvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Fair (40-59%):</strong> Some headers missing; security could be significantly improved.</li>
    <li><strong>Poor (&lt;40%):</strong> Critical headers are missing; site is vulnerable to common attacks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security audits:</strong> Verify your own site's header configuration before launch.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance checks:</strong> Ensure headers meet security standards and policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party audits:</strong> Evaluate partner sites or vendor security configurations.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous monitoring:</strong> Track header changes over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Best Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable HSTS with max-age of at least 1 year and includeSubDomains.</li>
    <li>Use a strict CSP that avoids unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval when possible.</li>
    <li>Set X-Frame-Options to DENY or SAMEORIGIN based on your needs.</li>
    <li>Always include X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.</li>
    <li>Remove information-disclosing headers like X-Powered-By and Server.</li>
  </ul>

    {"@type":"Question","name":"Which TLS version is secure?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"TLS 1.3 is the most secure. TLS 1.2 is acceptable but consider upgrading. TLS 1.0/1.1 and SSL are deprecated and insecure."}}
