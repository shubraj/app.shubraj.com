  <h2>Inspect Your HTTP Request Headers</h2>
  <p>Headers describe how your browser talks to servers—accepted formats, languages, compression, and more. Seeing them helps troubleshoot caching, redirects, and content negotiation.</p>

  <h3>What to Look For</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User‑Agent:</strong> Identify browser and platform when debugging compatibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Accept/Encoding:</strong> Confirm gzip/brotli and content types supported.</li>
    <li><strong>Authorization/Cookies:</strong> Ensure sensitive headers are sent only when intended.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Proxies and extensions may alter headers. Test in a clean profile when isolating issues.</li>
    <li>Be careful when sharing headers—redact tokens or session IDs.</li>
  </ul>
