  <h2>Trace and Analyze HTTP Redirect Chains</h2>
  <p>Follow HTTP redirect chains from any URL to see all intermediate redirects and reach the final destination. This tool helps identify redirect loops, inefficient chains, and optimization opportunities for better website performance and SEO.</p>

  <h3>Why Analyze Redirect Chains?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SEO optimization:</strong> Long redirect chains can hurt page rankings. Search engines prefer direct links.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Each redirect adds latency. Shorter chains mean faster page loads.</li>
    <li><strong>Loop detection:</strong> Identify infinite redirect loops that can break user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Verify redirect destinations aren't malicious or unexpected.</li>
    <li><strong>Migration verification:</strong> Confirm URL migrations redirect correctly to new locations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Redirect Types Explained</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>301 (Permanent Redirect):</strong> Tells search engines the page has permanently moved. Link equity is transferred.</li>
    <li><strong>302 (Temporary Redirect):</strong> Indicates a temporary move. Search engines keep the original URL indexed.</li>
    <li><strong>307 (Temporary Redirect):</strong> Similar to 302, but preserves the HTTP method (POST stays POST).</li>
    <li><strong>308 (Permanent Redirect):</strong> Similar to 301, but preserves the HTTP method.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Issues Detected</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Redirect loops:</strong> URLs that redirect back to themselves or create circular chains.</li>
    <li><strong>Too many redirects:</strong> Chains longer than 3-5 redirects are inefficient.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed protocols:</strong> Redirects between HTTP and HTTPS should be avoided.</li>
    <li><strong>Temporary redirects:</strong> Using 302/307 for permanent moves wastes redirect chains.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Best Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep redirect chains as short as possible (ideally 1-2 redirects maximum).</li>
    <li>Use 301 redirects for permanent URL changes to preserve SEO value.</li>
    <li>Ensure all redirects use HTTPS for security.</li>
    <li>Fix redirect loops immediately as they prevent pages from loading.</li>
    <li>Update internal links to point directly to final URLs instead of redirecting URLs.</li>
  </ul>
