  <h2>Convert Markdown to HTML (and Back) for Publishing</h2>
  <p>Paste Markdown to get clean HTML for blogs, docs, and CMS fields—or drop HTML to see the Markdown that would produce it. Great for moving content between systems.</p>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CMS migration:</strong> Translate existing posts without hand‑rewriting.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Keep source in Markdown and export HTML for portals.</li>
    <li><strong>Content cleanup:</strong> Remove brittle inline styles by round‑tripping.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Markdown features vary by platform. Stick to common patterns for portability.</li>
    <li>Sanitize HTML before embedding in user‑generated contexts.</li>
  </ul>
