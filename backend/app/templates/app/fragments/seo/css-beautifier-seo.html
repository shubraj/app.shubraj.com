  <h2>Reformat CSS for Clarity and Easier Maintenance</h2>
  <p>Readable stylesheets make it easier to find selectors, understand cascade effects, and review changes. Paste your CSS to normalize indentation, spacing, and line breaks without changing behavior.</p>

  <h3>When to Beautify</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Before code reviews:</strong> Reduce noise so diffs focus on real changes.</li>
    <li><strong>After minification:</strong> Inspect a compact file during a quick audit.</li>
    <li><strong>Legacy cleanup:</strong> Bring older styles in line with current conventions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Suggestions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt a formatter in CI to keep teams consistent automatically.</li>
    <li>Split large files into logical modules once formatting is tidy.</li>
  </ul>
