  <h2>Extract Images from Base64 Data URLs</h2>
  <p>Paste a Base64 data URL to recover the original image. This is useful when assets are stored inline in JSON fixtures or copied from design tools and you need the file back.</p>

  <h3>Typical Reasons to Decode</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clean up repositories:</strong> Replace long strings with proper image files.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspect assets:</strong> Confirm format, dimensions, and size before committing.</li>
    <li><strong>Regression checks:</strong> Verify that an inline asset wasn’t altered in transit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Data URLs include a MIME type prefix; keep it with the content when saving.</li>
    <li>If decoding fails, ensure the string is complete and hasn’t been truncated.</li>
  </ul>
