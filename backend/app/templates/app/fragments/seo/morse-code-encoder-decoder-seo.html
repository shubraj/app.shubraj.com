  <h2>Morse Code Encoding and Decoding Made Simple</h2>
  <p>Convert any text to Morse code (dots and dashes) or decode Morse code back to readable text. This tool supports letters, numbers, and common punctuation, with audio playback to help you learn Morse code patterns.</p>

  <h3>What is Morse Code?</h3>
  <p>Morse code is a method of encoding text using sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. Originally developed for telegraph communication, it's still used in radio communication, amateur radio, and as a learning tool.</p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Each character is converted to its corresponding Morse code sequence. Spaces between words become " / ".</li>
    <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> Morse code sequences are converted back to text by matching patterns to characters.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio Playback:</strong> The tool can play the Morse code audibly to help you learn the sound patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Morse Code Basics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dots (.) and Dashes (-):</strong> Dots are short signals, dashes are three times longer.</li>
    <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Letters within words are separated by spaces, words are separated by " / ".</li>
    <li><strong>Case Insensitive:</strong> Input text is automatically converted to uppercase for encoding.</li>
    <li><strong>Common Characters:</strong> Supports A-Z, 0-9, and punctuation like period, comma, question mark.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Learning Morse code:</strong> Practice encoding and decoding to improve your skills.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Encode messages for transmission via radio or other methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teach students about historical communication methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Use in amateur radio, escape rooms, or puzzle games.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips for Learning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with common letters like E (.), T (-), and A (.-).</li>
    <li>Use the audio playback feature to associate sounds with patterns.</li>
    <li>Practice with short words before moving to longer sentences.</li>
    <li>Memorize the most common patterns first (E, T, A, N, O, I).</li>
  </ul>
