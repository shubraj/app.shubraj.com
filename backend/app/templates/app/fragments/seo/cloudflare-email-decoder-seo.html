  <h2>Decode Cloudflare‑Protected Email Addresses</h2>
  <p>Cloudflare obfuscates emails in HTML to reduce scraping. Paste the encoded snippet to reveal the original address so you can contact site owners or audit your own pages.</p>

  <h3>When It’s Useful</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Customer support:</strong> Recover an address when the page hides it behind JavaScript.</li>
    <li><strong>QA and audits:</strong> Confirm that your site’s obfuscation works and decodes correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>Migrations:</strong> Extract addresses before moving content between platforms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Only decode content you’re authorized to use; respect site terms.</li>
    <li>Obfuscation is not encryption—treat decoded emails as personal data.</li>
  </ul>
