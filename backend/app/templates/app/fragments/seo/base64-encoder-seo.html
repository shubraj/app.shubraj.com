  <h2>Encode Text to Base64 for Safe Transport and Storage</h2>
  <p>Base64 encoding turns arbitrary bytes into plain text made of A–Z, a–z, 0–9, <code>+</code> and <code>/</code>. Use it when you need a text‑only representation that won’t break in JSON, cookies, environment variables, or simple logs.</p>

  <h3>Where Base64 Helps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Embedding small assets:</strong> Inline icons or fonts in CSS or HTML for quick demos.</li>
    <li><strong>Text‑only channels:</strong> Move binary data through systems that expect UTF‑8 text.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Compare encoded payloads across services for troubleshooting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Good Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep large binaries out of Base64 in production—file storage or CDNs are better.</li>
    <li>Remember that Base64 grows data by roughly 33%.</li>
    <li>Use URL‑safe variants when putting data in URLs or path segments.</li>
  </ul>
