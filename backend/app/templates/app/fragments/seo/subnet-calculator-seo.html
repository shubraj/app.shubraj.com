  <h2>Make IPv4 Subnetting Less Error‑Prone</h2>
  <p>Calculate network, broadcast, host range, and usable hosts from a CIDR or IP/mask quickly. It’s a lightweight helper for network planning, lab setups, and exam practice.</p>

  <h3>What You Can Check</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Network and broadcast addresses for a given CIDR.</li>
    <li>Wildcard mask and dotted‑decimal netmask equivalents.</li>
    <li>First and last usable host addresses and total host count.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Remember that /31 and /32 have special semantics for point‑to‑point and hosts.</li>
    <li>Document subnets alongside VLANs to avoid overlap and confusion.</li>
  </ul>
