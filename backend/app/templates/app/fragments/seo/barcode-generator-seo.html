  <h2>Create Barcodes That Scan Cleanly in Real‑World Conditions</h2>
  <p>Generate common barcode symbologies for labels, inventory, tickets, or packaging. The tool focuses on practical outputs: clear bars, correct quiet zones, and sizes that work for handheld scanners and phone cameras.</p>

  <h3>Supported Uses and Symbologies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EAN/UPC:</strong> Retail product identifiers with standardized lengths.</li>
    <li><strong>Code 128:</strong> Compact, alphanumeric—ideal for logistics and internal IDs.</li>
    <li><strong>Code 39:</strong> Simple encoding for legacy or low‑density needs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Print and Display Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain adequate quiet zones on all sides; scanners rely on the margins.</li>
    <li>High contrast matters—dark bars on a light, non‑glossy background work best.</li>
    <li>Avoid resizing raster exports; scale vector/SVG when possible to keep edges crisp.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Typical Workflows</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Batch print shelf labels or box stickers from a single master list.</li>
    <li>Embed barcodes in PDFs for pick lists, tickets, or event badges.</li>
    <li>Test new label materials and printer settings before large runs.</li>
  </ul>
