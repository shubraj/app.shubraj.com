  <h2>Turn Small Images into Base64 for Inlining</h2>
  <p>Inlining images as Base64 can simplify quick demos and single‑file prototypes. Drop an image here to generate a data URL you can paste into HTML, CSS, or JSON fixtures.</p>

  <h3>When Inlining Makes Sense</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design previews:</strong> Share a minimal HTML file without external assets.</li>
    <li><strong>Component docs:</strong> Keep example code self‑contained and easy to copy.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Skip asset pipelines while exploring ideas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Trade‑offs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Base64 increases size; prefer normal image files in production.</li>
    <li>Long data URLs can be unwieldy in code reviews and diffs.</li>
    <li>CDNs cache images better than inline strings for real apps.</li>
  </ul>
