  <h2>Encode and Decode URLs the Way Browsers Expect</h2>
  <p>Whether you’re cleaning up query strings, generating shareable links, or troubleshooting redirects, correct percent‑encoding matters. This tool encodes reserved characters and decodes already‑encoded text so your URLs behave consistently across browsers, servers, and proxies.</p>

  <h3>When to Use URL Encoding</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Query parameters:</strong> Encode values that may contain spaces, quotes, or special characters.</li>
    <li><strong>Path segments:</strong> Avoid breaking routes when user‑generated text becomes part of the path.</li>
    <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Ensure third‑party APIs and webhooks receive exactly what you intend.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Practical Guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer encoding values, not entire URLs, unless you know the consumer expects it.</li>
    <li>Double encoding is a common bug. If text already contains <code>%</code> sequences, decode before re‑encoding.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of character sets. UTF‑8 is standard; mixing encodings leads to subtle issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Typical Workflows</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Transform raw input into a safe query value for an API call.</li>
    <li>Decode a redirect target to confirm it matches your allow‑list logic.</li>
    <li>Normalize user‑generated links before storing or displaying them.</li>
  </ul>
