  <h2>Generate UUIDs and ULIDs for Unique Identifiers</h2>
  <p>Create random UUIDs (v4) or timeâ€‘sortable ULIDs for database keys, test data, and distributed systems. ULIDs are lexicographically sortable, which helps with indexing and logs.</p>

  <h3>Choosing an ID Type</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>UUID v4:</strong> Simple, widely supported, good general default.</li>
    <li><strong>ULID:</strong> Sorts by time, base32 output, friendly for logs and URLs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid guessable identifiers for sensitive resources.</li>
    <li>Let databases generate IDs when possible to avoid collisions.</li>
  </ul>
