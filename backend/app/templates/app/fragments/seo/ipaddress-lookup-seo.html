  <h2>Look Up IP Addresses for Context and Troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>IP lookups can reveal useful context like approximate location, ISP, and hosting vs residential clues. That context helps with incident response, analytics, and understanding how requests reach your application.</p>

  <h3>When IP Lookups Help</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Support and fraud triage:</strong> Spot unusual geolocation or known data center ranges.</li>
    <li><strong>Access logs:</strong> Enrich entries to correlate traffic patterns with regions or providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Routing issues:</strong> Verify which network an address belongs to when debugging reachability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Geolocation is approximate and can change as ISPs reassign ranges.</li>
    <li>Respect privacy and applicable laws when processing IP data.</li>
  </ul>
