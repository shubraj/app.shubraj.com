  <h2>Pick Exact Colors from Any Image</h2>
  <p>Upload an image and sample pixels to get HEX, RGB, and HSL values. Lock swatches, copy code‑ready values, and build palettes for UI themes or brand assets.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Zoom in to sample edges or anti‑aliased text precisely.</li>
    <li>Average samples over a small area to reduce noise.</li>
    <li>Record palette notes so teammates know where colors came from.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Match brand colors from screenshots or PDFs.</li>
    <li>Extract UI colors from design mockups.</li>
  </ul>
