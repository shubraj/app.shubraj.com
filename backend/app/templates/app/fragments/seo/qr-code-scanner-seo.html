  <h2>Scan QR Codes Directly in Your Browser</h2>
  <p>Use your device camera to scan QR codes without installing an app. Useful for quick checks, testing generated codes, or accessing links on a desktop.</p>

  <h3>Make Scanning Easier</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure adequate lighting and hold the code steady.</li>
    <li>Fill most of the camera view to help the decoder.</li>
    <li>Clean the lens if autofocus struggles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Privacy</h3>
  <p>Scanning happens locally in your browser. Camera access is only used to detect and decode the QR image in view.</p>
