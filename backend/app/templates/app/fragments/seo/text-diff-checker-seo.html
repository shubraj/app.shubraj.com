  <h2>Compare Texts and Spot Differences Quickly</h2>
  <p>Paste two versions of a document and highlight what changed. It’s useful for proofreading, code snippets, and content reviews when you don’t want a full VCS workflow.</p>

  <h3>How It Helps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proofing:</strong> Catch missed edits or unintended deletions.</li>
    <li><strong>Change review:</strong> Share a minimal diff instead of an entire file.</li>
    <li><strong>Migrations:</strong> Verify content transforms step by step.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Options</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignore case and whitespace to focus on structural changes.</li>
    <li>Swap sides to confirm the diff reads as intended.</li>
  </ul>
