  <h2>Inspect and Clean EXIF Metadata from Photos</h2>
  <p>Photos often include hidden metadataâ€”camera model, lens, orientation, GPS, timestamps. View details for debugging image issues or remove sensitive fields before sharing.</p>

  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Strip GPS and device info from pictures you post online.</li>
    <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Check orientation and color profiles that affect rendering.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflows:</strong> See how editors or pipelines change metadata across steps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a clean export workflow for public sharing.</li>
    <li>Keep originals with metadata for archival when needed.</li>
  </ul>
