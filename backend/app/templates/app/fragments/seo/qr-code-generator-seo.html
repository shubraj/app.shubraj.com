  <h2>Create QR Codes That Scan Reliably</h2>
  <p>Generate QR codes for URLs, text, Wi‑Fi credentials, or contact details. Controls for error correction and size help ensure good scans on screens and printed materials.</p>

  <h3>Tips for Better Scans</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use sufficient contrast—dark code on a light background.</li>
    <li>Avoid placing codes on busy images; leave quiet zones around the edges.</li>
    <li>Pick higher error correction for small prints or potential damage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Usage Ideas</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Link to product pages, menus, and event schedules.</li>
    <li>Share Wi‑Fi settings without typing credentials.</li>
    <li>Embed contact information for quick saves.</li>
  </ul>
