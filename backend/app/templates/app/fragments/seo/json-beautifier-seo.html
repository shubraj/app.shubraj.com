  <h2>Pretty‑Print JSON for Faster Debugging</h2>
  <p>Readable JSON makes it easier to spot missing fields, wrong types, and subtle formatting mistakes. Paste raw JSON and get a clean, indented version that’s friendly to scan and discuss.</p>

  <h3>Good Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API design:</strong> Review payloads with teammates or clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Logs and traces:</strong> Expand dense entries to understand context.</li>
    <li><strong>Contracts:</strong> Compare expected vs actual responses side by side.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Validate schemas with your usual tooling in addition to formatting.</li>
    <li>Mask secrets before sharing JSON in tickets or chats.</li>
  </ul>
