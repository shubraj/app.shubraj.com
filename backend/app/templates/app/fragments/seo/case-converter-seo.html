  <h2>Convert Text Case for Readability and Consistency</h2>
  <p>Switch between lower case, upper case, title case, snake_case, kebab‑case, and more. It’s a small utility that saves time when cleaning copy, variable names, or file titles.</p>

  <h3>Typical Tasks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Normalize headings or labels before publishing.</li>
    <li>Refactor identifiers to match a project’s naming convention.</li>
    <li>Prepare slugs for URLs or filenames.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Title case rules can vary, double‑check brand names and acronyms.</li>
    <li>For code, prefer automated linters to keep teams consistent.</li>
  </ul>
