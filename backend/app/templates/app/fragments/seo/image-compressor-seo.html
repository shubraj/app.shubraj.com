  <h2>Compress Images Without Guesswork</h2>
  <p>Reduce file size while preserving visual quality. Preview results, compare before/after, and export in modern formats for faster pages and smaller emails.</p>

  <h3>Guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Choose formats wisely:</strong> WebP/AVIF for photos, PNG/SVG for flat graphics.</li>
    <li><strong>Balance quality vs size:</strong> Adjust compression until artifacts are acceptable.</li>
    <li><strong>Resize large photos:</strong> Downscaling often saves more than compression alone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Workflows</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prepare assets for blogs, landing pages, and newsletters.</li>
    <li>Optimize screenshots for tickets and documentation.</li>
  </ul>
