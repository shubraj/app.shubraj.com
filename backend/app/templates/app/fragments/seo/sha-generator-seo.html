  <h2>Create SHA Hashes (SHA‑1/256/512) for Verification</h2>
  <p>Generate cryptographic hashes of text for integrity checks and signatures. SHA‑256 is a sensible default for most modern workflows; SHA‑512 is also widely used.</p>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>File verification:</strong> Compare local digests with published checksums.</li>
    <li><strong>Release processes:</strong> Produce hashes for downloads and artifacts.</li>
    <li><strong>Data pipelines:</strong> Detect changes between stages without storing raw content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use SHA alone for password storage—use dedicated password hash functions.</li>
    <li>When signing, rely on mature libraries that pair hashing with correct key handling.</li>
  </ul>
