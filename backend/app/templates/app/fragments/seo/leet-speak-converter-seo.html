  <h2>Convert Text to Leet Speak (1337) and Back</h2>
  <p>Transform normal text into leet speak, also known as "1337 speak" or "leet," where letters are replaced with numbers and special characters that look similar. This tool supports encoding text to leet speak at multiple intensity levels and decoding leet speak back to readable text.</p>

  <h3>What is Leet Speak?</h3>
  <p>Leet speak (from "elite" → "leet" → "1337") is an alternative alphabet that uses numbers, symbols, and special characters to replace letters. It originated in online gaming and hacker communities in the 1980s and 1990s, and is still used today in gaming, online forums, and social media for style or to bypass text filters.</p>

  <h3>How Leet Speak Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Letter Replacement:</strong> Each letter can be replaced with one or more characters that look similar (e.g., A→4, E→3, I→1).</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Patterns:</strong> Some letters have multiple leet equivalents (e.g., S can be 5 or $).</li>
    <li><strong>Intensity Levels:</strong> Different levels control how many letters are replaced and which patterns are used.</li>
    <li><strong>Case Preservation:</strong> Original case is typically converted to uppercase for encoding, but spacing and punctuation are preserved.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common Leet Patterns</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> 0 (O), 1 (I/L), 3 (E), 4 (A), 5 (S), 7 (T), 8 (B)</li>
    <li><strong>Symbols:</strong> @ (A), $ (S), ! (I), # (H), + (T)</li>
    <li><strong>Complex:</strong> |\/| (M), |\| (N), \/\/ (W), |2 (R)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Usernames, clan tags, and in-game communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Stylized text for posts and comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Bypassing Filters:</strong> Sometimes used to evade word filters (though filters are getting smarter).</li>
    <li><strong>Nostalgia:</strong> Retro internet culture and 90s internet aesthetic.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Understanding leet speak patterns for decoding purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Intensity Levels Explained</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Low:</strong> Only a few letters are replaced, maintaining readability.</li>
    <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Most letters replaced with common, simple patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>High:</strong> Heavy replacement with variations and multiple character patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Extreme:</strong> Maximum complexity using the most complex multi-character patterns available.</li>
  </ul>
