  <h2>Hash Passwords with bcrypt for Safer Storage</h2>
  <p>bcrypt is a password hashing function designed to be slow and resistant to brute‑force attacks. Use it to derive a hash from a password before storing credentials in a database.</p>

  <h3>What Matters with bcrypt</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cost factor:</strong> Higher cost increases CPU work; choose a value your servers can handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Unique salts:</strong> bcrypt generates a salt per hash to protect against rainbow tables.</li>
    <li><strong>No plain text:</strong> Never store or log raw passwords—only the bcrypt hash.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Operational Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Benchmark cost values on your actual infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Rotate credentials and enforce strong password policies.</li>
    <li>Pair hashing with rate limiting and MFA for real defenses.</li>
  </ul>
