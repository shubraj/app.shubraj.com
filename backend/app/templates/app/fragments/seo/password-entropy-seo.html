  <h2>Understand Password Entropy and Real‑World Strength</h2>
  <p>Entropy estimates how hard a password is to guess by measuring the size of the character pool and the length of the secret. While not a guarantee, it’s a practical proxy for resisting brute‑force attempts.</p>

  <h3>What Drives Entropy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Length:</strong> Each extra character multiplies the search space.</li>
    <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Mixing letters, numbers, and symbols increases the pool.</li>
    <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Common patterns reduce effective entropy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer long passphrases or 16+ character passwords when allowed.</li>
    <li>Avoid predictable substitutions (P@ssw0rd!), which tools already account for.</li>
    <li>Use MFA and a password manager instead of memorizing many secrets.</li>
  </ul>
