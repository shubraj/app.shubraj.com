  <h2>Decode Base64 Strings Back to Readable Text or Bytes</h2>
  <p>Paste a Base64 string to recover the original content. This is handy for reversing inline assets, inspecting API payloads, and validating that upstream systems are encoding data as expected.</p>

  <h3>Common Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Decode tokens, small files, or thumbnails embedded in JSON.</li>
    <li><strong>Data recovery:</strong> Pull human‑readable text back from logs or config files.</li>
    <li><strong>Content checks:</strong> Confirm that an image or PDF wasn’t truncated or corrupted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If decoding fails, check for unexpected whitespace or missing padding.</li>
    <li>Ensure the string uses the expected variant (standard vs URL‑safe).</li>
    <li>Large payloads are better handled as files rather than pasted text.</li>
  </ul>
