  <h2>Convert CSV and JSON Without Losing Structure</h2>
  <p>Flip between CSV and JSON to suit the task at handâ€”spreadsheets for editing, JSON for APIs. The converter keeps field names, respects quoting, and preserves arrays where possible.</p>

  <h3>Practical Uses</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data cleaning:</strong> Edit a dataset in a spreadsheet, then convert back to JSON.</li>
    <li><strong>API prototyping:</strong> Generate sample payloads from a CSV you already have.</li>
    <li><strong>Imports/exports:</strong> Move data between tools with minimal friction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure header rows are present when converting CSV to JSON objects.</li>
    <li>Quote fields that include commas or newlines to avoid misalignment.</li>
  </ul>
