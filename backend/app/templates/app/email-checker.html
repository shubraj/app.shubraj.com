        <h2>Validate Your Email Address Easily with Our Email Checker</h2>
        <p>
            Email is a way to send messages electronically between people. Each email address has a specific format, which usually looks like this: <strong>username@example.com</strong>. The part before the "@" is the username, and the part after is the domain that manages the email.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure that your emails reach the right person, servers use MX (Mail Exchange) records. These records tell the server where to send emails for a specific domain, helping route your messages correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our <a href="{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{{ request.path }}">Email Checker</a> helps you verify if an email address is valid. Just enter the email you want to check and click on "Verify Email." Our tool will quickly check its status to make sure you only send messages to active accounts.
